# Lab: Load Balancing Azure Web Apps

1. Wherever a path to a file starts at *[Repository Root]*, replace it with the absolute path to the directory in which the 20487 repository resides. 
 For example, you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487**, change the path: *[Repository Root]***\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01** to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01**.
2. Wherever **{YourInitials}** appears, replace it with your actual initials. For example, the initials for **John Doe** will be **jd**.

### Preparation Steps

5. To change the directory to the **setup** folder, run the following command:
   ```pwsh
   cd [Repository Root]\AllFiles\Mod10\Labfiles\Lab1\Setup
   ```
6. Run the following command:
   ```pwsh
   .\createAzureServices.ps1
   ```
   > **Note**: If prompted for Security warning type **R** and then press **Enter**.
7. You will be asked to provide a **Subscription ID**, which you can get by performing the following steps:
   1. Open a browser and navigate to **http://portal.azure.com**. If a page appears asking for your email address, enter your email address, and then click **Continue**. Wait for the sign-in page to appear, enter your email address and password, and then click **Sign In**.
   2. In the search box on the top bar, type **Subscriptions** and in the results, click **Subscriptions** listed under **Services**.

   public async Task Invoke(HttpContext httpContext)
   {
      httpContext.Response.Headers.Add("X-BlueYonder-Server", Environment.MachineName);

      await _next(httpContext);
   }
   ```

11. To add an extension method for **IApplicationBuilder**, outside the class braces but inside the namespace braces, enter the following code:
   ```cs
   public static class MachineNameMiddlewareExtensions
   {
      public static IApplicationBuilder UseMachineNameMiddleware(this IApplicationBuilder builder)
      {

      }
   }
   ```
12. On the **Explorer pane** on the left, locate the **Startup** file, and then click the file.
13. To the **Startup** file, add the following **using** statement:
   ```cs
   using BlueYonder.Flights.Service.Middleware;
   ```
13. To use **Exception Handling Middleware**, locate the **Configure** method, and then enter the following code above the **app.UseHttpsRedirection();** line:
   ```cs
   app.UseMachineNameMiddleware();
   ```
14. In **VSCode**, click **File** and then click **Save All**.

   ```url
   https://blueyondermod10lab1{YourInitials}.azurewebsites.net/api/destinations
   ```
6. In the **Response Headers** section, locate the **X-BlueYonder-Server**, and then verify that the **Status** is **200**.
7. Refresh the page a few times.
   > **Note**: You should always get the same **machine name** value in **X-BlueYonder-Server** header.

### Exercise 3: Test the Load Balancing Without Affinity

     { "id": 4, "cityName": "London", "airport": "Heathrow" },
     { "id": 5, "cityName": "Paris", "airport": "Charles De Gaulle" }
   ]
   ```
4. In the **Network** tab, view the **X-BlueYonder-Server**.
   > **Note**: In **X-BlueYonder-Server**, now there are two server instances, because of which you can get two different values for the machine name.
5. Close all open windows.
